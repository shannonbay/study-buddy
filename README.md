A repeat reading app which breaks a text into bite-size chunks for more focused listening.  It also pauses and resumes play-back by detecting background noise levels via the microphone.   This gives the listener time to verbally repeat or paraphrase the content, and also makes disruptions less of a hassle.  Finally, it transcribes your own speech.
